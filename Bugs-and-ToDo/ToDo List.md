TODO:
  - Add Rampdown instead of flywheel terminate ( must implement into program )
  - Add encoder functionality to flywheelRamp ( must initialize in pre autonomous) (must set in conjunction with maxMotorSpeed)
  - ~~fix flywheel adjust buttons~~ Add Starting speed buttons with different speeds.
  - ~~Encoder drive and Gyro Turns~~ Implement Encoder Drive and Gyro Turns
  - ~~arcade / tank drive function changer with LCD in pre autonomous. ~~
  - ~~If encoded motors are at preset speed run feed!~~
  - Encoder implementation into flywheel control during autonomous and during match
  - Battery voltage based ajustment of flywheel speed
